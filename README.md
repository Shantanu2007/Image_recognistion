# Image_recognistion

Welcome to the Image Recognition project leveraging supervised learning techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate identification of iconic landmarks. This project is specifically designed to classify images into four distinct classes: Taj Mahal, India Gate, Raigadh, and Qutub Minar. Leveraging the power of TensorFlow, Keras, and the MobileNetV2 architecture, this implementation offers robust and efficient image recognition capabilities. The dataset comprises meticulously curated images of each landmark, enabling the model to achieve high accuracy in predicting the class to which a particular image belongs. The CNN architecture, specifically MobileNetV2, is fine-tuned and trained on this dataset, resulting in a sophisticated neural network capable of discerning intricate details and features unique to each landmark. Users can seamlessly input an image, and the model will predict the class to which it belongs with remarkable precision. The project also includes comprehensive documentation and codebase, enabling developers and enthusiasts to understand, reproduce, and extend the functionality for their image recognition needs.This Project is for Image Recognistion which will take an image and will predict from which class the perticular image belongs and  the correct image with high accuracy.Here, I have taken four data set of TajMahal,IndiaGate,Raigadh and Qutubminar. Here I have implemented supervised Learning and CNN as a network for image identification.Tensorflow ,keras ,mobilenetv2 etc has been used to implement the required identification.
